# Monorepo guideline

## Explanation

### 🧰 What is a Monorepo?

A monorepo is a single repository that stores all of your code for every project, said code generally depends on each other.

### ⚙️ Why are we using a Monorepo?

We decided to use the monorepo structure to achieve the following:

- Improve code readability.
- Make Testing and code maintenance simpler, improving code quality.
- Provide us with complete, functional and tested releases ready to be used by their related dependencies
- Diminish CI/CD execution time.

### ⬆ Block extension structure

- extension (monorepo)
- packages
  - background
  - ui
  - provider
